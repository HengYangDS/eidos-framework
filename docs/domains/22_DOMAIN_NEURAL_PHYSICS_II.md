## 21.1 The Hamiltonian of Agency

An Agent follows a path defined by its Hamiltonian:
$$ H = H_{internal} + H_{environment} + H_{interaction} $$

*   **Internal**: Memory, Personality, Tool definitions.
*   **Environment**: The API, the Web, the OS.
*   **Interaction**: The Action loop (Thought $\to$ Action $\to$ Observation).

## 21.2 The ReAct Loop (Cyclotron)

The **ReAct (Reason + Act)** loop acts as a **Cyclotron**, accelerating the
agent's understanding.
1.  **Thought**: Hypothesis generation (Wavefunction).
2.  **Action**: Experiment/Tool Call (Measurement).
3.  **Observation**: Result (Collapse).
4.  **Repeat**: Iterate until convergence.

## 21.3 Swarm Intelligence (Many-Body Physics)

A single agent is a hydrogen atom. A **Swarm** is a complex molecule or plasma.
*   **Hierarchical Swarm**: Nucleus (Manager) + Electrons (Workers).
*   **Democratic Swarm**: Lattice structure. Consensus voting.

**Emergence**: New properties (Intelligence) emerge from the interaction of
simple agents, just as temperature emerges from particle motion.

## 21.4 Debate (Adversarial Dynamics)

To improve truthfulness, we construct **Adversarial Pairs**.
$$ |\Psi\rangle = |Proponent\rangle + |Opponent\rangle $$
They exert opposing forces. The equilibrium point (Nash Equilibrium) is the
Truth.

## 21.5 Memory as Phase Space

An Agent's memory is its trajectory in **Phase Space**.
*   **Short-term**: Position and Momentum (Current context).
*   **Long-term**: The holographic record of past trajectories (Vector Store).

## 21.6 Engineering Best Practices

1.  **Damping**: Agents can oscillate (loop) forever. Add friction (Max Steps).
2.  **Energy Limit**: Constrain the token budget per mission.
3.  **Checkpointing**: Save the state of the Cyclotron so you can restart the
    particle if it crashes.
