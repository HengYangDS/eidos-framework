# Rosetta Table: Metaphor ↔ Engineering

- Bosons (Forces) → Operators (Map, Filter, Batch, Window, etc.)
- Fermions (Particles) → Data (Scalars, Batches, Streams)
- Ports (Holographic Boundaries) → Ingress/Egress (HTTP, Files, DB, Message Bus)
- Field (Context) → Execution Context (trace_id, deadline, config)
- Hamiltonian (Pipeline) → Topology/DAG/Plan (Flow of operators)
- Thermodynamics (Cost) → Performance model (latency/throughput/memory)
- Entanglement (Concurrency) → Structured concurrency & composition (&)
- Superposition (Choice) → Fallback composition (|)
- Interference (Ensemble) → Additive composition (+)
- Holography (UI Boundary) → API/CLI/UX contracts

See Engineering Track for the pragmatic guides corresponding to each metaphor.
